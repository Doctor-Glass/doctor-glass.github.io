      <p class="section-content">Hi, I'm Nate Hodson. I'm a developer of many talents, and I'm always looking to expand my skillset and try new things. My favorite thing to do is to approach novel problems and try to find interesting solutions to them.</p>
      <p class="section-content">I started off in high school, teaching myself Python and writing basic games for my engineering club using PyGame. Concerned about the limitations of the system, I wrote a prototype game engine that eventually incorporated 3D rendering, though the code has unfortunately been lost to time.</p>
      <p class="section-content">From there I started teaching myself C# while working with Unity and Blender, cooking up my own assets as I worked. I contributed to a few projects run by friends of mine on a freelance basis and took part in a few game jams in my university's Game Design Club. Here I developed a strong passion for making games, turning ideas and drawings into fully-fledged playable products.</p>
      <p class="section-content">During this time I also dabbled in a few multiplayer game projects, which gave me the opportunity to teach myself SQL and MySQL</p>
      <p class="section-content">My first job was as a machine operator at a lumber mill, where I applied my talents by writing code for computer-operated milling and cutting machines. In my free time I expanded my skillset to include JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</p>
      <p class="section-content">From there I enlisted in the United States Army as a Signals Intelligence Analyst. This gave me an opportunity to develop my skills in cybersecurity and network security, as well as to explore network design and secure software principles.</p>
      <p class="section-content">In my free time I like to play EVE Online, where I run a player group, or corporation. This has given me extensive leadership experience, as well as experience with deploying, configuring, and maintaining web applications.</p>
      <p class="section-content">I'm currently looking for a job in the game development or cybersecurity fields that will challenge me and allow me to explore and extend my horizons. If that sounds like someone you need on your team, feel free to <a href="#contact">reach out to me!</a></p>
